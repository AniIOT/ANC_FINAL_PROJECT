### Files:
"CNN-identification.py" is CNN network used for pre-training in "CNNfix+LSTM" method.
"cnn_ckpt" is the model produced by "CNN-identification.py".
"read-CNNckpt.py" generates the characteristics which is the input for LSTM by reading the pre-trained CNN model.("CNNfix+LSTM" method)
"CNN+LSTM.py" reads the input generated by "read-CNNckpt.py" for training.("CNNfix+LSTM" method)
"unfix-cnn-lstm（hor）.py" and "unfix-cnn-lstm（ver）.py" is the network for "CNN+LSTM" method.

### How to use code files:
* Step 1: Enter your training dataset path (*Note: Folder name will be train/inertial signals)
* Step 2: Enter your testing dataset path (*Note: Folder name will be test/inertial signals)
* Step 3: Enter your training label path (*Note: train/y_train.txt is the label file)
* Step 4: Enter your testing label path (*Note: test/y_train.txt is the label file)
* Step 5: Run the code to train and save model
* Step 6: Use the saved model to identify gaits from your dataset using identification output
